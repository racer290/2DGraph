# 2DGraph
My attempt on a (tiny) plotting application.

That's it, it takes an expression, parses it and then plots it. The parser is based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3422673/evaluating-a-math-expression-given-in-string-form/26227947#26227947) recursive descent parser.

Reasons why one could call Java a potato:
<ul> <li>No method to draw a point in java.awt.Graphics</li>
<li>No logarithm to a free-to-choose base in java.util.Math</li> </ul>
